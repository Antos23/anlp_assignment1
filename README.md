## Tasks
In  this  assignment,  we were asked to  use  language  modeling  to  detect  what  language  a  document  is written in.  Specifically, we wrote Python code to do the following:
- build a trigram language model over characters (not words!):  read in a text file, collectcounts for all character 3-grams, estimate probabilities, and write out the model to a file;
- generate random output according to a similar model provided by us (which youâ€™ll needto read in from a file);
- read in a test document and compute its perplexity according to one of these models.
